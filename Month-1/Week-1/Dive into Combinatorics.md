# Combinatorics
In combinatorics, enumeration means counting. We use combinatorics to calculate the "total number of possible outcomes".
It deals with the number of ways that certain pattern can be formed. Two examples of these are:
* 1.Counting combinations
* 2.Counting permutations
#### It is just like Systematic counting but it is not as easier as we think as it contains the systematic knowledge.
* 1.Addition 
* 2.Multiplication
* 3.Inclusion and exclusion
* 4.Combination and permutation
