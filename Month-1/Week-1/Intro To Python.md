# Introduction to python:
Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented and functional programming.
### Hello, World!
For printing an output via python a programmer is required to write print.
* Example: print("Hello Hamza")

### Variables and Types:
Python is completely object oriented, and not "statically typed". You do not need to declare variables before using them, or declare their type. Every variable in Python is an object.
Python supports two types of numbers
* 1)Integers (whole number)
* 2)Floating point (decimals)

### Strings:
Strings are defined either with a single quote or a double quotes.
* ‘HELLO’
* “HAMZA MEHMOOD”
### Lists:
* Lists are very similar to arrays. They can contain any type of variable.

### append()
* Adds an element at the end of the list.
### copy()
* Returns a copy of the list exactly the same one.
### extend()
* Add the elements of a list to the end of the current list.
### insert()
* Adds an element at the specified position.

### clear() 
* Removes all the elements from the list.
### index()
* Returns the index of the first element with the specified value.
### count()
* Returns the number of elements with the specified value.
### remove() 
* Removes the first item with the specified value
### sort()
* Sorts the list.
### pop()	
* Removes the element at the specified position
### reverse()
* Reverses the order of the list
