# Probability:
 
Probability provides information about the likelihood that something will happen. OR Probability is the chances of occurrence.
Probability = No of ways an event occur / No of possible outcomes.
## Examples:
* Tossing of Coin
* Rolling a dise
* Weather forecast
* Sports and gaming strategies
* Determining blood group
* Analyzing political strategies

### Mutually Exclusive Events:
 
In probability theory, two events are said to be mutually exclusive if they cannot occur at the same time or simultaneously.
In other words, mutually exclusive events are called disjoint events.
If two events are considered disjoint events, then the probability of both events occurring at the same time will be zero.
Example:
If A and B are the two events, then the probability of disjoint of event A and B is written by: 
Mutually Exclusive Event = P (A and B) = 0
If A and B are said to be mutually exclusive events then the probability of an event A occurring or the probability of event B occurring that is P (a ∪ b) formula is given by
P(A) + P(B), i.e., 	P (A Or B) = P(A) + P(B) P (A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B).

### Not Mutually Exclusive Events:
 
The two events occur at the same time, they are called not mutually exclusive events.
Example:
If we draw a card from an ordinary deck of 52 playing cards, it can be both a king and a diamond. Therefore, kings and diamonds are not mutually exclusive.

#### Multiplicative Role:
In multiplicative role two types of events are occur:
* 1.Independent Event
Example: Tossing a coin.
Formula: P (A and B) =P (A) * P (B)
* 2.Dependent Event
Example: Taking a card from deck.
Formula: P (A and B) =P (A) * P (B/A)
