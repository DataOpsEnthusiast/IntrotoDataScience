# What is Data Science?
Data Science is the field of study which aims to extract insights and useful information from raw data. This information can be used in several ways; make better decisions, predict future data points, discover patterns, and much more like,

*	It is about asking the Right Questions and exploring the data.
*	Modeling the data using various Algorithms.
*	Communicating and Finalizing the results.

## Need of Data Science in Which Industry/Field?
* 1.Automotive Industry
* 2.Airlines
* 3.Better Route Planning
*	4.Predict any Delays
*	5.Airplane Flight Decision

### So Data Science is Mainly used for:
* 1.Better Decision Making
* 2.Predective Analysis
* 3.Pattern Discovery

### Prerequisites for Data Science
#### 1.Curiosity
*	Be Curious when asking the Questions.
*	So that you ask the right Question.

#### 2.Common Sense
* Be Creative and come up with ways to use the data you have and try to solve Business Problems.

#### 3.Communication Skills
* If u r unable to communicate the results in Right and Appropriate way, the whole exercise will be Fail. 

#### 3.Machine Learning
* It is the backbone of Data Science.ML is one of many ways that DS uses to find solution of a Problem. 

#### 3.Mathematical Modeling

#### 4.Statistics

#### 5.Programming Language
*	Python or R for Executing DS modeling. 

#### 6.Databases
*	How data base works, how to handle data base, how to get data out of data base.
