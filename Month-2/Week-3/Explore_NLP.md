# What is natural language processing?
### Natural language processing (NLP) is the ability of a computer program to understand human language as it is spoken and written -- referred to as natural language.It is a component of artificial intelligence (AI).NLP has existed for more than 50 years and has roots in the field of linguistics. It has a variety of real-world applications in a number of fields, including medical research, search engines and business intelligence.
# How does natural language processing work?
### NLP enables computers to understand natural language as humans do. Whether the language is spoken or written, natural language processing uses artificial intelligence to take real-world input, process it, and make sense of it in a way a computer can understand. Just as humans have different sensors -- such as ears to hear and eyes to see -- computers have programs to read and microphones to collect audio. And just as humans have a brain to process that input, computers have a program to process their respective inputs. At some point in processing, the input is converted to code that the computer can understand.
# Applications of NLP
- Sentiment Analysis
- Text Classification
- Chatbots & Virtual Assistants
- Text Extraction
- Machine Translation
- Text Summarization
- Market Intelligence
- Auto-Correct
- Intent Classification
- Urgency Detection
- Speech Recognition
# Components of NLP
- Natural Language Understanding(NLU)
- Natural Language Generation(NLG)
# Natural Language Understanding(NLU):
* It helps the machine to understand the data. 
* It is used to interpret data to understand the meaning of data to be processed accordingly.
* It solves it by understanding the context, semantic, syntax, intent, and sentiment of the text. 
* **Example:** If you asked: "How's today ?". Now, what if the system answers, "Today is October 1, 2020, and Thursday." Is the system providing you the correct answer? No, Because here, users want to know about the weather.
* Therefore, we use it to learn the text's right meaning of some errors.
# Natural Language Generation(NLG):
* It is a sub-component of Natural language processing that helps in generating the output in a natural language based on the input provided by the user. 
* This component responds to the user in the same language in which the input was provided say the user asks something in English then the system will return the output in English.
* They can predict which words should be generated next (for example, in an email you're writing).
